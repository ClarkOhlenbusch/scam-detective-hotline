# Marlowe

A hackathon project that helps people pause before they get scammed. Users submit their phone number, tap **Start Silent Monitor**, and receive a callback that streams live transcript to an on-screen scam coach.

## Project Goal
We chose this project because AI-enabled scams amplify already widespread, underreported extortion and impersonation fraud: the FBI’s IC3 reported 39,416 extortion victims with about $54.3M in losses in 2022, and 14,190 government impersonation scam victims with over $394M in losses in 2023, with older adults disproportionately harmed ([FBI ICR](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2022_ic3report.pdf), [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/portland/news/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-scammers-impersonating-fbi-agents-and-other-government-officials)). Our goal was to build a practical tool that helps people pause and verify during high-pressure scam situations.

This weekend, we built a working prototype of **Marlowe**: users can enter their phone number, tap **Open a Case**, and receive an instant AI callback for a **live** second opinion. We also developed and tested the core user flow and voice/scam test scenarios.

## Hackathon Build Notes
This project was built with a hybrid workflow:
- Framework + initial skeleton generated with **Vercel v0**
- Extended and refined with **handwritten code**
- AI-assisted iteration using **Codex**, **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Kiro CLI**
- Deployed on **Vercel**
- **Supabase** used for backend services/infrastructure
- **Twilio** used for outbound monitor calls and live call transcription callbacks
- **Groq** used for real-time coaching analysis on transcript chunks

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI primitives, shadcn-style component architecture
- **Backend/API:** Next.js Route Handlers (`app/api/call/route.ts`)
- **Voice/Calling:** Twilio (call initiation + live transcription webhooks)
- **LLM Coaching:** Groq Chat Completions API
- **Infra:** Vercel deployment + Supabase backend services

## Features
- Guided setup flow to capture and normalize user phone numbers
- Silent monitor call flow with live transcript ingestion
- Real-time scam risk scoring and concise coaching prompts
- Server-side call initiation with safe error handling

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm`

### Install and run
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Database migration
Run SQL migrations in your Supabase/Postgres database:

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/001_create_tenants.sql
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/003_live_call_tables.sql
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/004_enable_realtime_live_tables.sql
```

`scripts/004_enable_realtime_live_tables.sql` enables Supabase Realtime publication and demo-friendly read policies for live call streaming tables.

### Production build
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Lint
```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Mock sanity flow
```bash
pnpm test:mock
```

## Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with at least:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=...
GROQ_API_KEY=...
```

Optional hardening:

```bash
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_SKIP_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION=0
```

Supabase-related variables may also be required for backend features (for example `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and service credentials) depending on your environment.

## Deployment
This project is configured for Vercel deployment. Push to your Git provider and import the repo in Vercel, then add required environment variables in project settings.

## Reflection
Our main challenge was designing something people could realistically use during a high-stress scam call, so we focused on a simple, fast user flow. We also attended Lucas Maley’s PM workshop, which helped us think more clearly about product design and feature prioritization.
