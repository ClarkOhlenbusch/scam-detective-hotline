# The Scam Detective Hotline

A hackathon project that helps people pause before they get scammed. Users submit their phone number, tap **Open a Case**, and receive a callback from an AI detective assistant for a fast second opinion.

## Project Goal
We chose this project because AI-enabled scams amplify already widespread, underreported extortion and impersonation fraud: the FBI’s IC3 reported 39,416 extortion victims with about $54.3M in losses in 2022, and 14,190 government impersonation scam victims with over $394M in losses in 2023, with older adults disproportionately harmed ([FBI ICR](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2022_ic3report.pdf), [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/portland/news/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-scammers-impersonating-fbi-agents-and-other-government-officials)). Our goal was to build a practical tool that helps people pause and verify during high-pressure scam situations—especially AI voice/deepfake scams that often target older adults and other vulnerable groups.

This weekend, we built a working hackathon prototype of **The Scam Detective Hotline**: users can submit their phone number, tap **Open a Case**, and receive a fast AI callback for a second opinion. We also developed and tested the core user flow and voice/scam test scenarios.

## Hackathon Build Notes
This project was built with a hybrid workflow:
- Framework + initial skeleton generated with **Vercel v0**
- Extended and refined with **handwritten code**
- AI-assisted iteration using **Codex**, **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Kiro CLI**
- Deployed on **Vercel**
- **Supabase** used for backend services/infrastructure
- **Vapi (Voice API)** used for voice agent orchestration and call initiation
- **Twilio** used for number provisioning to the voice agent

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI primitives, shadcn-style component architecture
- **Backend/API:** Next.js Route Handlers (`app/api/call/route.ts`)
- **Voice/Calling:** Vapi (voice agent orchestration + call initiation), Twilio (number provisioning)
- **Infra:** Vercel deployment + Supabase backend services

## Features
- Guided setup flow to capture and normalize user phone numbers
- E.164 phone validation and masking utilities
- One-tap case flow with clear states: idle, dialing, success, error
- Server-side call initiation with safe error handling

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm`

### Install and run
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production build
```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### Lint
```bash
pnpm lint
```

## Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` with at least:

```bash
VAPI_PRIVATE_KEY=...
VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=...
VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=...
```

Supabase-related variables may also be required for backend features (for example `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and service credentials) depending on your environment.

lib/                 # utilities (phone parsing/validation)

```

## Deployment
This project is configured for Vercel deployment. Push to your Git provider and import the repo in Vercel, then add required environment variables in project settings.

## Reflection
Our main challenge was designing something people could realistically use during a high-stress scam call, so we focused on a simple, fast user flow. We also attended Lucas Maley’s PM workshop, which helped us think more clearly about product design and feature prioritization.
