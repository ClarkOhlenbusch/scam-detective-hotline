## The Problem

AI-enabled scams are amplifying already widespread fraud:

- The FBI's IC3 reported **39,416 extortion victims** with ~$54.3M in losses in 2022 ([FBI IC3 Report](https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2022_ic3report.pdf))
- **14,190 government impersonation scam victims** with over $394M in losses in 2023 ([FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/portland/news/fbi-warns-public-to-beware-of-scammers-impersonating-fbi-agents-and-other-government-officials))
- Older adults are disproportionately harmed

Scammers use **urgency, fear, and isolation** to prevent victims from pausing to think. Marlowe gives people a **live second opinion** during the call itself — before they send money, share credentials, or comply with threats.

## Why This Is More Than a Wrapper
<img src="./public/marlowe_movie_1969.jpg" alt="Marlowe (1969) poster inspiration" width="95" align="right" />
Most "AI scam detector" demos paste text into a chatbot and call it a day. Marlowe is fundamentally different — we built a **live telephony feedback loop** that works on real phone calls, including iPhone calls that are normally completely gated from third-party access.

Here's what we actually pulled off this weekend:

1. **Live iPhone call transcription** — We orchestrate a Twilio-powered silent monitor call that bridges into the user's active conversation. Twilio's `<Transcription>` streams both sides of the call (`track="both_tracks"`) as partial and final transcript events via webhooks — giving us real-time access to audio that iOS normally locks down entirely.

2. **Near-real-time coaching pipeline** — Every transcript chunk hits our webhook, gets persisted to Supabase, and triggers a dual-layer analysis engine:
   - **Heuristic scoring** fires instantly using pattern-matched risk signals (gift cards, wire transfers, urgency language, credential harvesting, etc.)
   - **LLM analysis** via Groq runs on a rate-limit-aware schedule with exponential backoff, stabilized advice diffing, and score-movement dampening to avoid whiplash

3. **Live push to the client** — Supabase Realtime streams coaching updates, risk scores, and transcript chunks to the user's screen as the call happens. No polling. No delay.

4. **Self-healing call loop** — The TwiML uses a `<Pause>` + `<Redirect>` pattern to keep the transcription session alive indefinitely without dropping the call, automatically re-upping the connection every 60 seconds.

This isn't a chatbot. It's a **real-time telephony intelligence system** built in a weekend.

## Production-Grade Completeness

Despite being a hackathon build, Marlowe ships with real production hardening:

- **End-to-end integration testing** — A full mock flow (`pnpm test:mock`) provisions a tenant, saves a phone number, fires simulated Twilio webhook events (both form-encoded and JSON), waits for the coaching pipeline to produce a risk score ≥ 40, verifies call-ended status propagation, and asserts the entire loop. It even computes valid Twilio HMAC-SHA1 signatures so the webhook auth path is exercised.
- **Twilio webhook signature validation** — HMAC-SHA1 verification on every inbound webhook, with URL candidate generation to handle proxy/forwarding edge cases and constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
- **Rate limiting & cooldowns** — IP-based rate limiting on call initiation (5 calls/min) and phone setup (20/10min), plus per-tenant cooldowns (30s between calls) to prevent abuse.
- **LLM rate-limit resilience** — Exponential backoff with streak tracking on Groq 429s, automatic fallback to heuristic scoring during cooldown, and configurable RPM-derived intervals.
- **Row Level Security** — Supabase tables use RLS with explicit policies; server-side writes go through a service-role client that bypasses RLS.
- **Input validation everywhere** — E.164 phone normalization with US shorthand support, slug format validation, XML escaping in TwiML generation, and structured Zod schemas for LLM response parsing.
- **Database migrations** — Versioned SQL scripts for schema creation, Realtime publication setup, and demo tenant seeding.
- **Linting** — ESLint across the full codebase (`pnpm lint`).

## How It Works

```
User enters phone number → Marlowe calls them back via Twilio
                                    ↓
              Twilio bridges a silent monitor + starts <Transcription>
                                    ↓
              Both-track transcript streams to /api/twilio/webhook
                                    ↓
              Heuristic risk scoring fires immediately
              Groq LLM coaching runs on a rate-limited schedule
                                    ↓
              Supabase Realtime pushes advice + transcript to the UI
                                    ↓
              User sees live risk score, coaching, and "what to say" prompts
```

## Hackathon Build Notes

Built in a weekend with a hybrid workflow:

- **Vercel v0** — framework + initial skeleton
- **Handwritten code** — core telephony pipeline, webhook handling, coaching engine
- **AI-assisted iteration** — Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro CLI
- **Supabase** — backend services, Realtime, Postgres
- **Twilio** — outbound calls + live transcription
- **Groq** — real-time LLM coaching on transcript chunks

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm`
- A Supabase project
- A Twilio number with voice enabled

### Install and run
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` (the app redirects `/` to `/start`).

### Database setup
Run SQL migrations in your Supabase/Postgres database (in order):

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/001_create_tenants.sql
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/003_live_call_tables.sql
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/004_enable_realtime_live_tables.sql
```

Optional demo seed:

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING" -f scripts/002_seed_demo_tenant.sql
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local`:

Required:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=...
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=...
```

Optional:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=...
GROQ_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
GROQ_RPM_LIMIT=30
GROQ_MIN_INTERVAL_MS=2800
TWILIO_WEBHOOK_SKIP_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION=1
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
TENANT_ADMIN_OVERRIDE_TOKEN=...
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Notes:
- `GROQ_API_KEY` is optional. Without it, the app uses local heuristic advice only.
- Keep Twilio signature validation enabled in production (`TWILIO_WEBHOOK_SKIP_SIGNATURE_VALIDATION` unset or `0`).
- If `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`/`APP_BASE_URL`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` are unset, webhook URLs fall back to forwarded host headers.

```

## Testing

```bash
pnpm lint                # ESLint
pnpm test:mock           # End-to-end mock call/transcript sanity flow
```

`pnpm test:mock` expects the app running locally and exercises `/start`, `/api/tenant/phone`, `/api/twilio/webhook`, and `/api/call/live`.

---

## Deployment

Configured for Vercel. Import the repo into Vercel, set the environment variables above, run the SQL migrations in Supabase, and verify Twilio can reach your deployed `/api/twilio/webhook` endpoint.

---

## Reflection

Our main challenge was designing something people could realistically use during a high-stress scam call, so we focused on a simple, fast user flow. We also attended Lucas Maley’s PM workshop, which helped us think more clearly about product design and feature prioritization.
